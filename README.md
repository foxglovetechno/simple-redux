Understand and Implement Your Own Redux
Redux is one of the most popular Javascript State Management Libraries and mostly used with React, though it can be used with any other library or framework.  In an application, a state is like a global object which keeps a snapshot of the application’s data at that instance. If you want to trigger updates on separate components based on some action that the user performs, Redux makes it very easy with a function called a store. It’s a JavaScript object which keeps track of the whole application’s data.
Please note that this version of Redux is not production-ready nor has all the features and optimizations of Redux. However, we hope this helps you understand Redux in future projects.
